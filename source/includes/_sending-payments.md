### Key Features
**Overdraft**

OY! has established partnerships with third party lenders to credit a specific amount of funds that can be used for your disbursement needs. With this feature, you don’t need to top up the OY! balance to execute disbursements. Please contact our [business representative](partner@oyindonesia.com) for further details about this feature.

**Overbooking** 

OY! can use the funds directly from your Mandiri, CIMB, or BNI bank accounts for your disbursement needs. You will only need to top up the admin fee needed to execute the disbursements instead of the full amount of your disbursement. Please contact our [business representative](partner@oyindonesia.com) for further details about this feature.

**Check Transaction Status and Callback**

For all disbursements executed, you will receive notifications regarding your transaction whether it is successful, failed or pending. We also provide an API for you to check the transaction status manually. IP proxy is also available upon request to enhance the security and integrity of the callback you will receive. 

**Check Balance**

You can check your available balance at anytime to ensure that you have sufficient balance to execute a disbursement.
