Banks often have regular maintenance schedules which differ from one bank to another.

To ensure your convenience, we will queue any transaction requests submitted during the maintenance hours and automatically disburse them once the maintenance is over.

**What are closed and open amounts? What happens when the amount paid by the user is different from the declared amount in the created Payment Checkouts?** 

A closed amount is a configuration so that the payment checkout or invoice can only be paid if the actual declared amount is paid. The user will not be able to pay any amount other than the declared amount.

An opened amount is a configuration so that the payment checkout or invoice can be paid up to the declared amount (or any, if amount is not declared). If the user pays an amount that is different from the declared amount, the payment checkout will remain active. The payment checkout will only reflect a completed status when the full amount is paid in total.
