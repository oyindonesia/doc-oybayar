In the 1st callback, the settlement status is set to WAITING (because it is not yet settled to your Account Statement balance)
2. 2nd Callback -> To be sent after the settlement status is changed from WAITING into SUCCESS. For example, if the settlement status is changed into SUCCESS on 12 May 2021 at 15:00:00, that is also when we send the 2nd Callback to you. In the 2nd callback, the settlement status is SUCCESS
