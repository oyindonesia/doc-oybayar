# Accepting Payments

## API VA Aggregator 

Businesses are struggling to manage hundreds or even thousands of physical bank accounts that are used for different purposes. It causes significant overhead cost in terms of the amount of account maintenance and man hours needed for reporting and reconciliation purposes, combining different information from different accounts. 

Virtual Account (VA) is essentially a dummy account that is linked to a physical account and has all the physical account characteristics that enables a much easier reporting and reconciliation process by centralizing the money flow into the physical account. By issuing VAs, you can assign each VA for specific person and/or purposes.

![API VA Aggregator](images/va_diagram_1.png)

From the example above, it shows how payments made through the VAs are merely pass-throughs for the physical accounts to receive money. Without VAs, the above example might require up to 8 physical accounts from 2 different banks rather than 2 physical accounts from 2 different banks.

**OY! API VA Aggregator**

Our API VA Aggregator product provides you with the capabilities to create unique Virtual Account (VA) numbers as a bank transfer payment method for your customers while the fund movements take place through OY!'s physical account. It provides you with the capabilities to receive payments from your customers via bank transfer without having each respective bank account across multiple banks.  

Our virtual accounts are adjustable according to your needs. We offer options of static or dynamic accounts, single or mutli use accounts, opened or closed amounts, and determinable expiration dates. You can also track all created virtual accounts, incoming payments, and their respective details either through our API callback or the OY! dashboard. 

![API VA Aggregator](images/va_diagram_2.png)

**VA Payment Flow**

Your users will be able to pay into a Virtual Account through ATM, Mobile Banking, and Internet Banking.

### Key Features

1. **Support multiple banks** - Currently, we support virtual accounts (VA) at 6 banks: BCA, BNI, Mandiri, BRI, Permata, and CIMB Niaga
2. **Real-time settlement for majority of the banks** - Payment into a VA will settle in your OY! dashboard on a real-time basis for the majority of the banks (note: for BCA, the settlement will take place H+2 after payment is made into the VA)
3. **Transaction tracking and monitoring capability** - You can track all created VA, incoming payments, and their respective details through our API callback or the OY! dashboard. You will receive a callback all incoming transactions.
4. **Customizable VA types** - Refer to the table below for more informations on various types of VA:

| Type/Feature      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Static Virtual Account     | VA that has a lifetime validity. It will always be active until it is manually deactivated   |
| Dynamic Virtual Account  | VA that has a specific validity period. It will always be active until it is expired or manually deactivated       |
| Closed Amount Virtual Account   | VA that only accepts payment of a specific amount/declared amount     |
| Opened Amount Virtual Account  |  VA that accepts payment of any amount        |
| Single Use Virtual Account    | VA that expires after a single payment. A single use configuration can only be set up for a dynamic VA      |
| Multiple Use Virtual Account | VA that only expires when expiration date is reached or when it is manually deactivated        |

5. **Capability to update VA** 

Attribute that can be updated:

* amount
* is_single_use
* email
* trx_counter
* expired_time
* trx_expired_time
* username_display

Example:
* A static VA with a closed amount can be updated with a new closed amount hence it can work as a bill to be paid for a particular customer
* A static VA can be updated to a single use so it will be the last payment received from a particular customer
* A dynamic VA with a closed amount is updated to an opened amount so that it can accept payments for any amount

All of the VA information, even after they are updated, is available on the OY! dashboard or via API. Once a VA is updated, the new set of configuration will apply for that VA and the previous configure is overridden and no longer applicable

A transaction can exceed the due date, but the link can still be opened (because transaction due date and link expiration time are 2 separate things).|
| Partner User ID   | ID assigned for a specific user/customer|
| VA Static  | You can choose between "Disable" and "Enable". 'Disable" means a new VA number will be assigned for the respective Partner User ID (if the user chooses to pay via VA). "Enable" means we will assign a static VA for the respective Partner User ID (if the user chooses to pay via VA). The VA number assigned will be the same for the respective partner user ID|
| Customer Full Name | Full name of your customer that will be displayed in the invoice link. |
| Invoice Detail | You can choose between attaching the PDF file of your invoice and input the item list (such as Item Name, Price, and Quantity). Note that the subtotal of price and quantity inputted here must be the same with the total amount inputted in he field above. |
| Description   |The description of the payment link. Usually this is used to describe the purpose of the payment checkout page|
|Customer Detail |Details that can be specified: Customer Phone Number, Email, and Notes. We will send the payment checkout page link as well as the payment success receipt to the specified email address (if email address is filled in).|

Whether you create the link through URL, dashboard, or API, you can see the details of your link on the OY! Dashboard. The details that can be checked are the created date of the link, amount billed, amount received, expiration date, and status.

### Customizing the UI of Payment Checkout Link

In order to maintain a consistent brand experience for your users, you can customize the look and feel of your payment checkout link in the Dashboard, where you can do the following things;

-  Upload a logo
-  Choose the button and the theme color of the payment checkout link

How to customize the UI:

- Log onto business.oyindonesia.com 
- Go to Payment Checkout section in the dashboard
- Click the 'Settings" icon

![Payment Checkout](images/ui_customization_settings_icon.png)

- You will be redirected to the Settings page

![Payment Checkout](images/ui_customization_settings_page.png)

- Input the URL for your logo (If you’re using  [snipboard.io](https://snipboard.io/), the correct URL should be in “https://i.snipboard.io/image.jpg” format. If you’re using  [imgbb.com](https://imgbb.com/), the correct URL should be in “https://i.ibb.co/abcdef/image.jpg” format)

- Select your primary color (you can select from our available color picker tools or you can input the 6 digit #HEX code). This primary color will be the main theme color in your payment checkout link and the color of the text in the header

- Select your secondary color (you can select from our available color picker tools or you can input the 6 digit #HEX code). This secondary color will be the color of CTA button in your payment checkout link and the color of the text outside the header

![Payment Checkout](images/ui_customization_color_logo.png)

- Click "Save Changes"

Note:
-   By saving the change, the colours will be applied to the payment links previously created (before saving) as well as the payment links created after saving.
-   Please create new payment link after you successfully save changes to check the difference

Illustration;

If we pick green (#HEX code #067610) as the primary color and black (#HEX code #000000) as the secondary color, the look and feel will be as follows;
