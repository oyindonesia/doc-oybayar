### How to Use 

In order to create API biller transaction, a sufficient available OY! balance is required in the account. More details and instructions about topping up to your OY! account can you see here https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#top-up-oy-dashboard-tutorial.

Before you execute the bill payment, you have to verify the bill information from our [bill inquiry endpoint](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#bill-inquiry-biller-api). 

> Below is an example of the request body for inquiry:

```shell 
curl -X POST https://partner.oyindonesia.com/api/v2/bill 
-H 'content-type: application/json, accept: application/json, x-oy-username:myuser, x-api-key:987654' 
-d '{
    "customer_id": "512233308943",
    "product_id": "plnpost",
    "partner_tx_id": "Tx15048563JKFJ"
    }'
```

> It will return an [error message](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#api-biller-response-codes-biller-api) if the request is not valid. Otherwise, below is the sample response parameters that will be returned:

```json
{
    "status":{
        "code":"000",
        "message":"Success"
    },
    "data": {
        "tx_id": "a3d87877-e579-4378-844b-c06294fc9564",
        "partner_tx_id": "Tx15048563JKFJ",
        "product_id": "plnpost",
        "customer_id": "512233308943",
        "customer_name": "Plg.,De'mo 512233308943",
        "amount": 282380,
        "additional_data": "{\"customer_id\":\"512233308943\",\"customer_name\":\"Plg.,De'mo 512233308943\",\"admin_fee\":\"2.500\"}"
    }
}
```

> 

Next, send a request body to execute a bill payment request to be sent to our [bill payment endpoint](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#pay-bill-biller-api). 

> Below is an example of the request body for the bill payment: 

```shell
curl -X POST https://partner.oyindonesia.com/api/v2/bill/payment 
-H 'content-type: application/json, accept: application/json, x-oy-username:myuser, x-api-key:7654321' 
-d '{
    "partner_trx_id":"Tx15048563JKFJ", 
    "note" :"biller transaction test"
    }'
```

> Below is the sample response parameters that will be returned:

```json 
{
    "status":{
        "code": "102",
        "message": "Request is In progress"
    },
    "data": {
        "tx_id": "a3d87877-e579-4378-844b-c06294fc9564",
        "partner_tx_id": "Tx15048563JKFJ",
        "product_id": "plnpost",
        "customer_id": "512233308943",
        "customer_name": "Plg.,De'mo 512233308943",
        "amount": 282380,
        "note": "biller transaction test"
    },
}
```

> 

An endpoint to [check the transaction](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#get-bill-payment-status-biller-api) is also available and can be accessed at anytime. 

> Below is an example of the request body: 

```shell
curl -X POST https://partner.oyindonesia.com/api/b2/bill/status 
-H 'content-type: application/json, accept: application/json, x-oy-username:myuser, x-api-key:7654321' 
-d '{
    "partner_trx_id": "Tx15048563JKFJ"
    }'
```

> The above command returns a JSON structured similar like this:

```json
{
    "status":{
        "code": "000",
        "message": "Success"
    },
    "data": {
        "tx_id": "a3d87877-e579-4378-844b-c06294fc9564",
        "partner_tx_id": "Tx15048563JKFJ",
        "product_id": "plnpost",
        "customer_id": "512233308943",
        "customer_name": "Plg.,De'mo 512233308943",
        "amount": 282380,
        "additional_data": "\"{\\\"bill_period\\\":\\\"FEB2022\\\",\\\"total_amount\\\":\\\"282.380\\\",\\\"customer_id\\\":\\\"512233308943\\\",\\\"customer_name\\\":\\\"Plg.,De'mo 512233308943\\\",\\\"admin_fee\\\":\\\"2.500\\\",\\\"settlement_date\\\":\\\"09/03/2022 16:49\\\"}\"",
        "status": "SUCCESS"
    },
}
```

>

A callback with the following information will be sent to the callback endpoint that you can register with us. 

You can also [check your balance](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#get-balance) anytime to ensure you have sufficient balance from our endpoint.

> Below is an example of a request body to check the balance:

```shell
curl -X GET 'https://partner.oyindonesia.com/api/balance' 
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
-H 'Accept: application/json' 
-H 'X-OY-Username: janedoe' 
-H 'X-Api-Key: 7654321'
```

> Below is the sample response parameters that will be returned:

```json 
{
    "status":{
        "code":"000",
        "message":"Success"
    },
    "balance":100000000.0000,
    "pendingBalance":2000000.0000,

## Feature: Resend Callback

### Key Features

Retry Callback allows you to resend a callback of your transaction to your system. Initially, OY! will send a callback to your system after your transaction status has been updated. If your system failed to receive the callback, this feature can help you to retry the callback process. The process can be done in two ways


1. Automated retry callback
If the callback is not successfully received on the first try, the system will automatically retry the callback delivery. If that callback is still not received by the client's system, the system will automatically retry until 5 occurrences. The interval of the sending process will be detailed in the Callback Interval section. If all automated Retry Callbacks have been sent but still returned failed, the system will send an email notification to the email address set in the configuration.

2. Manual retry callback
Besides the automated process, you can manually request a callback via the dashboard.

### Registration and Set Up

Follow the instruction below to activate retry callback

1. Login to your account in OY! Dashboard
2. Open “Settings” and choose “Developer Option”. Choose “Callback Configuration”
3. Fill your callback URL in the related product that you want to activate. Make sure the format is right. You can click URL String Validation button to validate the URL format.
4. If you want to activate automated retry callback, check the Enable Automatic Retry Callback and fill in the email. The email will be used to receive a notification if all the automatic callback attempts have been made but still fail
5. Click "Save Changes". The configuration will not able to be saved if the callback URL or/and email format are not valid.


![Resend Callback](images/api_disburse_retry_callback_developer_option.png)

Don't forget to whitelist these IPs in order to be able to receive callback from OY: 54.151.191.85 and 54.179.86.72

If you want to manually resend a callback, you can follow the instruction below

1. Login to your account in OY! Dashboard
2. Open the API Disbursement menu
3. Click the "Resend Callback" button in the related transaction


![Resend Callback](images/api_disburse_resend_callback.png)



### Callback Interval
1st retry: realtime (after the first failed log received)
2nd retry: 1 min (after callback failed log for the 1st retry is received)
3rd retry: 2 mins (after callback failed log for the 2nd retry is received)
4th retry: 13 mins (after callback failed log for the 3rd retry is received)
5th retry: 47 mins (after callback failed log for the 4th retry is received)

If all automated Retry Callback (all the 5 attempts) has been sent but we still get a Failed response from your end, our system will send an automated email notification to the  email address that has been set in the configuration earlier


### Idempotency Key
To implement automated retry callback, you need to handle the idempotency logic in your system using the below key:

API Disburse: trx_id

## Reimbursement
OY! Reimbursement product provides the capability to handle employee reimbursement requests and fund disbursement on one platform. Reimbursement can be done easily without any employee signing up for an OY! Account. No technical integration is required to utilize the product.


### Key Features

Currently, the scheduled disbursement options are 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days, allowing flexibility in managing cash flows.
**Reimbursement Details** | Every reimbursement request can be accessed through the OY! dashboard, including the uploaded file, to ensure it matches the requested amount.
**Reimbursement Tracking** | For employees, no more hassle in checking reimbursement progress with the HR or finance team. Your employee will receive a tracking email to check progress in real-time.
