# Accepting Payments
## Payment Methods

### Bank Transfer - Virtual Account
#### Introduction 
To receive payments digitally from your customers, you can create a virtual account (VA) number for your transactions. Your customers can directly transfer the payment to the generated VA number and you will receive a notification (i.e. callback) from OY! once the transaction is considered complete. 

Currently, we offer VA service for 8 banks: 

1. Bank Central Asia (BCA) 
1. Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) 
1. Bank Mandiri 
1. Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) 
1. Bank CIMB & CIMB Syariah
1. Bank BTPN Jenius 
1. Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI)
1. Bank Permata & Permata Syariah

#### Main Features Availability
|VA Features|Payment Link|VA Aggregator|E-Wallet Aggregator|Payment Routing|
| :- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Open Amount|❌|✅|❌|❌|
|Closed Amount |✅|✅|❌|✅|
|Multiple Use VA Number |❌|✅|❌|✅|
|Single Use VA Number|✅|✅|❌|✅|
|Static (Lifetime)|❌|✅|❌|✅|
|Dynamic  |✅(set to 24 hours after VA number is generated)|✅|❌|✅|
|Customizable Number|❌|✅|❌|❌|


Regardless of the parameters of the Payment Link (e.g. open amount payment link, lifetime payment link, etc), your customers need to input the specific amount in the link to be able to choose a payment method successfully and proceed to payment. This is why if your customers choose to pay via VA - Payment Link, then the VA number generated can only accept the specified amount (i.e. closed amount) and can only be used for that particular transaction only (i.e. single use VA number). The expiry time for the VA generated via Payment Link is 24 hours after payment method confirmation from your customers.

If you want to add a personal touch to your customer’s VA payment journey, you may do so by creating a customized VA number. With this feature, you can custom the suffix of the VA number according to your customer’s billing number or phone number. For example, if you customer’s phone number is 08123456789, then when you create a customized VA number, the VA number result will be 23088123456789. 

To create customized VA numbers, you need to hit a different URL endpoint than the usual VA creation endpoint, the [API Create Customized VA](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#create-customized-va-va-aggregator). The API endpoints to [update](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#update-customized-va-va-aggregator) and [deactivate](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#deactivate-customized-va-va-aggregator) the customized VA number are also different from the non-customized VA number. In general, the customized VA numbers can receive multiple payments and have lifetime validity. Currently, this feature is only supported for BRI and CIMB. To activate this feature, you may contact your business representative for assistance.

### Bank Transfer - Unique Code
#### Intro
Unique Code is a type of bank transfer payment that adds/subtracts a unique amount (between Rp 1-999) to your billed amount. The unique amount acts as an identifier to complete transactions. Unlike virtual accounts where each customer gets a different account number, unique code always uses the same account number for all transactions. The destination account is under OY! Indonesia’s name (PT. Dompet Harapan Bangsa) and you can not modify the destination account with your account. Unique code also has operational hours where you can only create unique code transactions between 3 AM - 8.30 PM GMT+7. 

There are two approaches that you can use on unique code transactions: addition or subtraction approach. 

1. Addition Approach
   - By using the addition approach, the unique amount is added to your billed amount, meaning your customer will pay Rp 1-999 more than the billed amount. The additional amount will not be settled to your balance.
1. Subtration Approach
   - By using the subtraction approach, the billed amount is subtracted by the unique amount. In this case, your customer will pay Rp 1-999 less than the billed amount. However, worry not, as the amount settled to your balance is not deducted by the unique amount. The default approach is addition, but you can request to change the approach via your business representative.

As an example, if you create a unique code transaction with an amount of Rp 100.000, then OY! will generate a unique amount for that transaction. Let’s assume the unique amount generated for that transaction is Rp 100. If you use the addition approach, then your customer pays a total of Rp 100.100. However, if you use the subtraction approach, your customer pays a total of Rp 99.900. Using either approach, the amount settled to your balance is Rp 100.000.

#### Payment Type & Flow
##### Single Payment
Single payment is a type of payment that allows your customer to complete payments using e-wallet easily. 

There are two types of payment flow for Single Payment: Redirection (JumpApp) or Push Notification.

![E-wallet Redirection Flow](images/acceptingPayments/paymentMethod/payment_method_ewallet_redirection_sequence.png)

![E-wallet Push Notification Flow](images/acceptingPayments/paymentMethod/payment_method_ewallet_notification_sequence.png)

##### Direct Payment
Direct payment requires account linking, meaning that your customer must connect their e-wallet account to your system before completing payments. Direct payments offer a more seamless payment experience, as your customer does not need to open or get redirected to the e-wallet provider application to complete payments.

Direct Payments offers both payment with and without authorization (auto-debit). Direct Payment with authorization requires the customer to input a PIN or OTP on every transaction, while Direct Payment without authorization allows your system to deduct your customers balance without the need to enter a PIN or OTP. Direct payment without authorization is suitable for subscription use cases.

#### Activation

#### Simulate Payments
To get more understanding of e-wallet transactions behavior, you can simulate e-wallet Demo transactions that are created in the Demo environment. Here are the steps to simulate e-wallet payments via OY! Dashboard:

1. Open OY! Dashboard and navigate to the Demo environment
1. Open the “Settings” menu and click “E-wallet Callback”.
1. Insert the payment detail of the transaction you want to simulate:
   1. Choose the e-wallet provider: Shopeepay, DANA, LinkAja, or OVO.
   1. Insert the Transaction Reference Number. For e-wallet transactions that are created via API E-wallet, you can find the Ref Number inside “E-Wallet API menu”. Please look at the image below to guide you
   1. Input the amount of transaction
1. Once you input all the fields, you can simulate the payment by clicking “Send Callback”. If the payment is successful, a success notification will be shown inside the dashboard. OY! will also send the callback to your specified callback URL. If for some reason you did not receive any callback, please contact our customer service to help you solve the problem.

![E-wallet See Reference Number](images/acceptingPayments/paymentMethod/payment_method_ewallet_reference_number.png)

Specifically for Payment Link transactions, you can directly simulate the payment on the Payment Link by clicking “Bayar Tagihan''.

![E-wallet Simulate Callback Payment Link](images/acceptingPayments/paymentMethod/payment_method_ewallet_bayar_tagihan.png)

### Cards
#### Introduction 
OY! offers both debit and credit cards as a payment method for your customers. We currently accept VISA, Mastercard, and JCB. 

#### Feature Details 
1. Transactions are protected by 3DS – protecting you and your customers from fraudulent transactions 
1. Support multiple global network (Visa, Mastercard, JCB) – enabling you to process local and overseas transactions

To increase the chance of successful transactions, please ensure that your customers: 

1. Have enabled 3DS as an authentication method for each transaction made on their card
1. Have sufficient balance or credit limit for each transaction 
1. (Especially for overseas transactions) Have notified their card issuer (i.e. the bank or entity that issues the card) of their intention to conduct overseas transactions 

Minimum transaction amount with cards is Rp 15.000. There is no maximum transaction limit for each transaction. The limit depends on the availability of balance or credit limit for each card. 
#### Understanding Overseas Transactions 
Your customers may use credit and/or debit cards issued locally or internationally. If you plan to conduct overseas transactions, it is important to note that OY! can only create the transactions in IDR. This means that your customers can still use their overseas cards for payment, however the card will still be charged in IDR and settlement to your OY! balance will also be done in IDR. The cardholder's billing statement, however, will show the transaction amount in their local currency with foreign exchange rate & extra fees (if any) as applied by their issuer (i.e. the bank or entity that issues the card).

Some card issuers might not allow overseas transactions. Therefore, it is recommended for your customers to check with their issuing bank regarding country restrictions to reduce the chance of the transaction being declined by the issuer.
#### Transactions Declined by Issuer 
When a transaction attempt is submitted to your customer’s issuer (i.e. the bank or entity that issues the card), they usually have an automated system and parameters that help them in deciding whether or not to authorize the transaction. The parameters may include, but not limited to, behavior from past transactions, card details such as expiration date and CVV, and availability of funds.

Even though all of the card details seem correct, the funds are available and 3DS has been enabled for the card, it is possible that the transaction is declined by the issuer. Unfortunately, sometimes the decline reason provided by the issuer is too “generic”. If that’s the case, you may ask your customers to either use alternative cards or payment methods or to contact their issuer directly for more information on the decline reason. Due to privacy & security concerns, issuers can only discuss the specific reason why a transaction is declined to the respective cardholder. This means that issuer will most likely not entertain decline explanation requests via OY!.
#### Payment Flow 
Flow via Payment Link 

![Cards Flow via Payment Link](images/acceptingPayments/paymentMethod/payment_method_cards_flow_payment_link.png)

Flow via Payment Routing

![Cards Flow via Payment Routing](images/acceptingPayments/paymentMethod/payment_method_cards_flow_payment_routing.png)
#### Activation 

If you need to accept payments from your end-users via debit and/or credit cards, you may contact your Business Representative for more information and assistance on the activation process.

You will be directed to a page to mock the 3DS step (i.e. in the actual payment in production environment, you will receive an OTP sent to the phone number registered to your card by your issuing bank). Choose from the dropdown menu to successfully authenticate the transaction (note: you may also choose to simulate rejected transactions by selecting unsuccessful authentication from the dropdown).
1. Transaction will be successful 


## Payment Link
Payment Link is a pre-built checkout page that allows your business to easily and securely accept payments online. You can share the link to your customers and they can choose various payment methods that OY! supports inside the Payment Link. OY! supports up to 17 payment methods– including Bank Transfer, E-Wallet, QR Code (QRIS), Credit and Debit cards. Payment Links can be created without using any code/integration. However, if you need to create Payment Links from your website/application, OY! also provides Payment Link API.

There are two types of Payment Link:

|Payment Link Type|Characteristic|Use Case|
| :- | :- | :- |
|One Time|One link to accept single payment|One-Time payments|
|Reusable|One link to accept multiple payments and support lifetime payments|Top Up, Donation|

![Payment Link Preview](images/acceptingPayments/paymentLink/payment_link_overview_flow.png)

### Flow
![Payment Link One Time Flow](images/acceptingPayments/paymentLink/payment_link_sequence_diagram_payment_link_one_time.png)
![Payment Link Reusable Flow](images/acceptingPayments/paymentLink/payment_link_sequence_diagram_payment_link_reusable.png)
### Features
#### Customize Payment Link transaction configuration
Set your Payment Link configurations depending on the use case of your transactions. There are several things that you can configure:

1. List of Available Payment Methods
   - Set up the list of available payment methods that you allow for your customers. The payment methods available are Bank Transfer (via Virtual Account and Unique Code), Cards (Credit Card/Debit Card), E-Wallet, and QRIS
1. Amount type
   - Open Amount: Accept payments of any amount, or up to specified amount
   - Closed Amount: Only accept payments of the specified amount
1. Admin Fee type:
   - Include Admin Fee: Admin fee will be deducted from the amount once the fund is settled to your balance. Admin fee borne by merchant.
   - Excluded from total amount: Admin fee will be added to the customer's total payment. Admin fee borne by the customer. 
      Total amount to be paid by the customer = Specified Amount + Admin Fee. 
1. Payment Link Expiration Time 
   - By default, Payment Link Expiration Time is 24 hours. You can customize the Payment Link Expiration Time by days and/or hours. The maximum expiration time is 31 days + 23 hours.
   - Specifically for Reusable Payment Link, you can set the expiration time to “Lifetime”, meaning that the link does not have an expiration time and can accept payments any time unless the Payment Link is manually deactivated.

You can define your default configuration, so you will no longer need to fill in these fields again the next time you create a payment link. Save your default configuration by ticking  "Use this configuration for future transaction(s)” option when creating Payment Links. 

![Payment Link Save Configuration](images/acceptingPayments/paymentLink/payment_link_save_configuration.png)

#### Monitoring transactions via OY! Dashboard
All created Payment Link transactions are shown in the OY! Dashboard. Navigate to “Payment Link” → “One Time”/”Reusable” to see the list of created transactions. Inside the dashboard, you can see the details of the transactions, including all the transaction information inputted during creation, the status of transactions, and the payment reference number\*. The dashboard also has a feature to search, filter, and export the list of transactions in various formats: Excel (.xlsx), PDF (.pdf), and CSV(.csv)

![Payment Link Monitoring Transactions](images/acceptingPayments/paymentLink/payment_link_monitoring_transactions.png)

\*Payment Reference Number is an identifier of a payment attempt when the customer successfully completes a QRIS payment. The reference number is also stated in the customer’s receipt/proof of transaction. Only available for QRIS transactions.

#### Customize theme
By default, Payment Link uses OY’s default theme. However, the default theme might not suit your brand personality. In order to maintain a consistent brand experience for your users, you can customize the look and feel of your Payment Link, where you can do the following things:

1. Upload a custom logo
1. Choose the theme colors
1. Choose the button colors

If you use OY’s Account Receivable product, the customization of Payment Link also applies to the Account Receivable, and vice versa.

You can customize the theme for Payment Link through OY! Dashboard. Here are the steps to guide you in doing so:

1. Log onto OY! Dashboard via Desktop (<https://www.desktop-business.oyindonesia.com>). The menu is currently unavailable in the mobile web version and OY! Business App.
1. Go to the “Settings” menu and click “Payment Link Display”.
1. To customize the logo in the Payment Link, you must input the logo in a URL format (<https://example.com/image.jpg>).
   - If you do not have the URL for your logo, you can use online tools like [snipboard.io](https://snipboard.io/) or [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/).
   - Once you convert your logo to URL, the correct URL should look like this:
      - Snipboard.io: <https://i.snipboard.io/image.jpg>
      - Ibbmg: <https://i.ibb.co/abcdef/image.jpg> 
1. To change the header color in the Payment Link, you can choose a color from the Color Picker or you can type the HEX color code in “Header Color” (e.g. #FFFFFF). 
1. You can choose a different color for the buttons inside the Payment Link. Choose a color from the Color Picker or type the HEX color code in “Button & Link Color”.
1. Save the changes. The changes will be applied to all payment links created in real-time. You can see when the last Payment Link Display was modified.

![Payment Link Customizing Theme](images/acceptingPayments/paymentLink/payment_link_customizing_theme.png)

Here is the example of the Payment Link before and after it is customized. The header’s color is customized using brown color and the button’s color uses green color.

![Payment Link Customized](images/acceptingPayments/paymentLink/payment_link_customize_theme.png)

#### Embedding Payment Link to your website/application
Create a seamless payment experience for your customers by inserting a created Payment Link to your website or application. Customers can stay on your page without being redirected to another page to complete the payments. There are many ways that you can show a Payment Link inside your page, and here are several suggestions that you can use: Pop Up - Center, Pop Up - Right, Pop Up - Left, and Slide - Right. Please refer to [Embed Payment Link](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#pop-seamless-payment-experience-fund-acceptance) in the API Docs to see detailed implementation of inserting Payment Link to your application.
#### Refund payments to customer
When your customer receives a defective product or the product is not delivered, they might request to refund the payment. You can directly refund payments to your customer’s account via OY! Dashboard. A refund can either be full or partial. A full refund gives your customers the entire amount back (100%). A partial refund returns the amount partially. 

Refunds are free of charge. However, the admin fee charged for the original payment is not refunded by OY! to your balance.

There are several requirements that must be met to issue a refund:

1. Refunds can only be issued up to 7 calendar days after the transaction is marked as successful.
1. You have enough balance that allows us to deduct the amount of the transaction that should be refunded. 
1. A refund can only be issued once for each successful transaction, whether it is a full or partial refund.
1. Refunds must be issued during operational hours, depending on the payment method. Refer to the table below.

Currently, refunds are only available for e-wallet payments. 

|Payment Method|Refund Feature|Operational Hours|
| :- | :- | :- |
|<p>DANA	</p><p></p>|Full Refund, Partial Refund|00\.00 - 23.59 GMT+7|
|ShopeePay|Full Refund|05\.00 - 23.59 GMT+7|
|LinkAja |Full Refund|00\.00 - 23.59 GMT+7|
|OVO|Not supported|-|

Here are the steps to do refunds for Payment Link transactions:

1. Log in to your OY! Dashboard with your username and password that you registered with.
1. Open “Payment Link” menu and choose “One Time”/“Reusable”, depending on your transactions
1. Search record of the transaction that wants to be refunded. Under the “Action” column, you can click the three-dots button and click “Refund E-Wallet” to issue a refund.
1. If the refund does not meet the requirement above, an error message will show up and you can not continue the refund process.
1. However, if the transaction is eligible for a refund, a pop up will be shown to continue the refund process
1. For partial refund, you can fill the amount to be refunded
1. Make sure that you have enough balance to issue a refund. If you do not have enough balance, an error message will show up. You can top up your OY’s balance first.
1. Once you successfully issue a refund, the transaction status changes to “Refunded”. 
1. You can see the refunded transaction in the “Account Statement” page by clicking “Transaction Report” → “Account Statement”.

#### Retry notification/callback for successful payments

If you use Payment Link API, OY! sends a notification/callback to your system once a transaction is marked successful. Therefore, you will be notified if the customer has already completed the payment. There might be a case where your system does not receive the notification successfully. 

By enabling Retry Callback, OY! will try to resend another callback to your system if your system does not receive the callback successfully. You can request to resend a callback using Manual Retry Callback or Automatic Retry Callback. 

##### Manual Retry Callback

Manual Retry Callback allows you to manually send callbacks for each transaction from OY! Dashboard. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Login to your account in OY! Dashboard
1. Open “Payment Link” and choose "One Time"/"Reusable" depending on the transaction
1. Search the record of the transaction and click 3 dots button under “Action” column
1. Make sure that you have set up your Callback URL via “Settings” → “Developer Option” → “Callback Configuration”
1. Make sure to whitelist OY’s IP to receive callbacks from OY! 
   - 54.151.191.85
   - 54.179.86.72
1. Click “Resend Callback” to resend a callback and repeat as you need

![Payment Link Manual Retry Callback](images/acceptingPayments/paymentLink/payment_link_manual_resend_callback.png) 
##### Automatic Retry Callback
Automatic Retry Callback allows you to receive another callback within a certain interval if the previous callback that OY! sent is not received successfully on your system. OY! will try to resend other callbacks up to 5 times. If your system still does not receive any callbacks after 5 retry attempts from OY, OY! will notify you via email. You can input up to 6 email recipients and it is configurable via OY! Dashboard. 

Callback Interval: Realtime → 1 minute (after the initial attempt)→ 2 minutes (after the first retry attempt)→ 13 minutes (after the second retry attempt) → 47 mins (after the third retry attempt) 

OY! sends the first callback to your system once the transaction is successful on OY!’s side. If your system fails to receive the callback, OY! will send the first retry callback attempt to your system immediately. If your system still fails to receive the callback, OY! will send the second retry callback attempt 1 minute after timeout or getting a failed response from your side. The process goes on until you successfully receive the callback or all retry callback attempts have been sent.

Automatic Retry Callback is not activated by default. You can see the guideline below to enable Automatic Retry Callback:

1. Login to your account in OY! Dashboard
1. Go to “Settings” and choose “Developer Option". 
1. Choose “Callback Configuration” tab
1. Input your callback URL in the related product that you want to activate. Make sure you input the correct URL format. Please validate your callback URL by clicking “URL String Validation”
1. If you want to activate automated retry callback, tick the Enable Automatic Retry Callback for related products. You must input the email recipient(s) to receive a notification if all the callback attempts have been made but still failed in the end.
1. Make sure to whitelist OY’s IP to receive callbacks from OY
   - 54.151.191.85
   - 54.179.86.72
1. Make sure to implement the idempotency logic in your system. Use “tx\_ref\_number” parameter  as idempotency key to ensure that multiple callbacks under “tx\_ref\_number”  key should not be treated as multiple different payments.
1. Save the changes

![Payment Link Automatic Retry Callback](images/acceptingPayments/paymentLink/payment_link_automatic_callback_configuration.png)  
#### Multi Entity Management
Multi Entity Management is a feature that can help you handle multiple OY! accounts under one entity. The account that acts as an admin is called a Main Entity and the accounts that can be controlled by the admin are called Sub Entity. 

Using this feature, you are able to accept payments from your customers through Payment Link that is created on behalf of a Sub Entity. When your users make a successful transaction, the transaction will be recorded in the Sub Entity’s balance. As a Main Entity, you are equipped with the ability to view the Sub Entities' balance and transaction list anytime through Multi Entity → Sub Entity Statement.

Please refer to the [Multi Entity Management](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#how-to-use-multi-account-management) section in this documentation for detailed information

\*Payment method expiration time is different from Payment Link expiration time. Payment method expiration is counted from when the customer confirms a payment method, meanwhile Payment Link expiration time is counted from when the Payment Link is created. You can only customize Payment Link expiration time. 

Example: You create a Payment Link that accepts Virtual Account (VA) and QRIS as Payment Method and set the Payment Link expiration time to 2 hours. Your customer opens the Payment Link and chooses QRIS as the payment method. OY! will generate the QR and the QR can be paid within the next 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, the QR expires and your customer must choose another payment method. This time, your customer chooses VA as payment method. OY! will generate the VA number and the VA validity is 1 hour and 30 minutes because the remaining Payment Link expiry time is 1 hour and 30 minutes. After 2 hours, your customer is not able to open the Payment Link since the Payment Link has expired.

### Checking transaction status
All created Payment Link transactions are shown in OY! Dashboard. Navigate to “Payment Link” → “One Time”/”Reusable” to see the list of created transactions. Inside the dashboard, you can see the details of the transactions, including all the transaction information inputted during creation, status of transactions, and the payment reference number. The dashboard also has a feature to search, filter, and export the list of transactions in various formats: Excel (.xlsx), PDF (.pdf), and CSV(.csv)

There might be times that your customer already completed the payments but the transaction status is not updated to success. In this case, there are several ways to check the status of a transaction:

1. Customers can directly check the status of the transaction by clicking “Check Status” button on the Payment Link page
1. You can check the status of the transaction by hitting API Check Status. Please refer to this section in the API Docs. [Check Status Payment Link - API Docs](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#api-payment-status-fund-acceptance).

### Receiving fund to balance
Once a transaction is paid by the customer, OY! updates the transaction status and sends notification to your system indicating that the transaction has been paid, and settles the funds to your OY! balance. Each payment method has a different settlement time, varying from real-time to D+2 Working Days. 


## VA Aggregator
Businesses are struggling to manage hundreds or even thousands of physical bank accounts that are used for different purposes. It causes significant overhead costs in terms of the amount of account maintenance and manhours needed for reporting and reconciliation purposes, combining different information from different accounts.

Virtual Account (VA) is essentially a dummy account that is linked to a physical account and has all the physical account characteristics that enable a much easier reporting and reconciliation process by centralizing the money flow into the physical account. By issuing VAs, you can assign each VA for a specific person and/or purposes.

Virtual Account (VA) Aggregator is a feature that is specifically designed to generate Virtual Account that enable you to receive payments from your end-users via virtual account (VA) bank transfer. If you intend to use multiple payment methods to receive payment for one transaction, you should consider Payment Link and Payment Routing instead. 

Generally, you may create a VA number for your customers via API VA Aggregator. However, if you prefer to create VA without API integration, then you may do so via OY! Dashboard by clicking the Virtual Account (Created VA) tab under the “Receive Money” section.

</table>

5. Capability to Update VA 
   1. After you have created the VA number, you are still able to modify the parameters below: 
      - VA Amount (amount) 
      - Multiple Use / Single Use (is\_single\_use) → you may update a single use VA to be a multiple use VA and vice versa 
      - Email (email)
      - Transaction Counter (trx\_counter) → you may update the number of payments a VA number can accept
      - Transaction Expired Time (trx\_expired\_time) → the expiration time of a transaction of a VA number
      - Expired Time (expired\_time) → the expiration time of a VA number. The VA expiration time must be at least equal or greater than the transaction expiration time 
      - Username Display (username\_display) → the VA name that is displayed when your customer inputs the VA number in their mobile/internet banking application 
   1. Once a VA is updated, the new set of configuration will apply for that VA and the previous configuration is no longer applicable
1. Automatic Callback & Retry Callback
   - You will get a callback for each successful VA payment from your customers via API. In addition, you may activate our “Enable Automatic Retry Callback” via OY! Dashboard (Settings → Developer Option → Callback Configuration tab). By activating this feature, if on the first try the callback is not successfully received by your system, then OY! system will automatically retry the callback delivery until 5 attempts. If all callback attempts still returned failed, OY! system will send email notification to email address that has been set in your configuration.
   - You will also get a callback for each successful transaction fund settlement to your OY! balance 
1. Minimum & Maximum Amount 
   - Minimum amount for each VA transaction is Rp 10,000 (for closed amount) 
   - Maximum amount for VA transactions depends on the banks:

Inside the dashboard, you can see the details of the transactions, including all the transaction information inputted during creation, status of transactions, and the payment reference number. The dashboard also has a feature to search, filter, and export the list of transactions in various formats: Excel (.xlsx), PDF (.pdf), and CSV (.csv)

![Monitor E-wallet Aggregator Transaction](images/acceptingPayments/ewalletAggregator/ewallet_aggregator_monitoring_transactions.png)
#### Receipt for successful payments
Customers can receive receipt of successful payments via email(s) that you provided during the creation process. Configure sending receipt via emails to your customers by going through these steps:

1. Log in to your OY! Dashboard account
1. Go to “Settings” → “Notifications”
1. Click “Receive Money (To Sender)”
1. Choose “Enable Success Notification” for E-Wallet API
1. Input your logo to be put on the email in URL format (<https://example.com/image.jpg>) 
    - If you do not have the URL for your logo, you can use online tools like [snipboard.io](https://snipboard.io/) or [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/).
    - Once you convert your logo to a URL, the correct URL should look like this:
      - Snipboard.io: <https://i.snipboard.io/image.jpg>
      - Ibbmg: <https://i.ibb.co/abcdef/image.jpg>
1. Save the changes by clicking “Save”
1. Create an E-Wallet transaction via API  and input the customer’s email address in the “email” parameter. 
1. Your customer will receive successful receipt to the emails once payment is made

![Receipt for successful Payment](images/acceptingPayments/ewalletAggregator/ewallet_aggregator_monitoring_transactions.png)

Note: If you do not put any of your customer’s email during transaction creation, OY! will not send any receipt via email even though you enabled the notification configuration
#### Retry notification/callback for successful payments
OY! will send a notification/callback to your system once a transaction is marked successful. Therefore, you will be notified if the customer has already completed the payment. There might be a case where your system does not receive the notification successfully. 

By enabling Retry Callback, OY! will try to resend another callback to your system if your system does not receive the callback successfully. You can request to resend a callback using Manual Retry Callback or Automatic Retry Callback. 

##### Manual Retry Callback
Manual Retry Callback allows you to manually send callbacks for each transaction from OY! Dashboard. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Log in to your account in OY! Dashboard
1. Navigate to “E-Wallet API ”
1. Search the record of the transaction and click 3 dots button under “Action” column
1. Make sure that you have set up your Callback URL via “Settings” → “Developer Option” → “Callback Configuration”
1. Make sure to whitelist OY’s IP to receive callbacks from OY! 
   - 54.151.191.85
   - 54.179.86.72
1. Click “Resend Callback” to resend a callback and repeat as you need

![Manual Retry Callback](images/acceptingPayments/ewalletAggregator/ewallet_aggregator_manual_retry_callback.png)
##### Automatic Retry Callback
Automatic Retry Callback allows you to receive another callback within a certain interval if the previous callback that OY! sent is not received successfully on your system. OY! will try to resend other callbacks up to 5 times. If your system still does not receive any callbacks after 5 retry attempts from OY, OY! will notify you via email. You can input up to 6 email recipients and it is configurable via OY! Dashboard. 

Callback Interval: Realtime → 1 minute (after the initial attempt)→ 2 minutes (after the first retry attempt)→ 13 minutes (after the second retry attempt) → 47 mins (after the third retry attempt) 

OY! sends the first callback to your system once the transaction is successful on OY!’s side. If your system fails to receive the callback, OY! will send the first retry callback attempt to your system immediately. If your system still fails to receive the callback, OY! will send the second retry callback attempt 1 minute after timeout or getting a failed response from your side. The process goes on until you successfully receive the callback or all retry callback attempts have been sent.

Automatic Retry Callback is not activated by default. You can see the guideline below to enable Automatic Retry Callback:

1. Login to your account in OY! Dashboard
1. Go to “Settings” and choose “Developer Option". 
1. Choose “Callback Configuration” tab
1. Input your callback URL in the related product that you want to activate. Make sure you input the correct URL format. Please validate your callback URL by clicking “URL String Validation”
1. If you want to activate automated retry callback, tick the Enable Automatic Retry Callback for related products. You must input the email recipient(s) to receive a notification if all the callback attempts have been made but still failed in the end.
1. Make sure to whitelist OY’s IP to receive callbacks from OY
   - 54.151.191.85
   - 54.179.86.72
1. Make sure to implement the idempotency logic in your system. Use “tx\_ref\_number” parameter as the idempotency key to ensure that multiple callbacks under “tx\_ref\_number”  key should not be treated as multiple different payments.
1. Save the changes

![Automatic Retry Callback](images/acceptingPayments/ewalletAggregator/ewallet_aggregator_automatic_retry_callback.png)

#### Refund transactions to customer
When your customer receives a defective product or the product is not delivered, they might request to refund the transaction. You can directly refund transactions to your customer’s account via OY! Dashboard. A refund can either be full or partial. A full refund gives your customers the entire amount back (100%). A partial refund returns the amount partially. 

Refunds are free of charge. However, the admin fee charged for the original transaction is not refunded by OY! to your balance.

There are several requirements that must be met to issue a refund:

1. Refunds can only be issued up to 7 calendar days after the transaction is marked as successful.
1. You have enough balance that allows us to deduct the amount of the transaction that should be refunded. 
1. A refund can only be issued once for each successful transaction, whether it is a full or partial refund.
1. Refunds must be issued during operational hours, depending on the payment method. Refer to the table below.

Currently, refunds are only available for DANA, ShopeePay, and LinkAja. 

|Payment Method|Refund Feature|Operational Hours|
| :- | :- | :- |
|DANA	|Full Refund, Partial Refund|00\.00 - 23.59 GMT+7|
|ShopeePay|Full Refund|05\.00 - 23.59 GMT+7|
|LinkAja |Full Refund|00\.00 - 23.59 GMT+7|
|OVO|Not supported|-|

If you use Refund API, OY! will send a notification to your system via callback once a transaction is successfully refunded [Refund Callback - API Docs](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#callback-parameters-e-wallet-refund-callback). You can also check the status of your refund request via API Refund Check Status. Refund [Check Status - API Docs](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#get-e-wallet-refund-status-api-e-wallet-aggregator)

### Creating E-wallet transactions
Create E-wallet Transactions: Use this API to create an E-wallet transaction for your user

You can create E-Wallet transactions via API only. Here are the guidelines to create E-wallet transactions via API:

1. Integrate API Create E-wallet transactions to your system. [Create E-wallet - API Docs](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#https-request-create-e-wallet-transaction)
1. Hit OY!’s API to Create E-wallet transaction.
1. OY! will return the information to complete the payment
   - For e-wallets that use the redirection method (i.e. ShopeePay, DANA, LinkAja), OY! will return the e-wallet URL to complete the payment. You can share the URL to your customer.
   - For e-wallets that use the push notification method (i.e. OVO), the e-wallet provider will send a notification to your customer’s e-wallet app to complete the payment

Note: When you hit Create E-Wallet Transaction endpoint in Staging/Demo environment, it will always return the same ewallet_url & success_redirect URL in the response: https://pay-dev.shareitpay.in/aggregate-pay-gate. You cannot simulate payment by clicking this URL.

In order to be able to simulate payment, please refer to this section: Simulate [E-Wallet Payments - Product Docs](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#e-wallet-payment-methods)

### Completing transaction
Each e-wallet provider has a different method to complete the transaction, redirection or push notification method. ShopeePay, LinkAja, and DANA use a redirection method. Meanwhile, OVO uses a push notification method. Please refer to these guidelines for completing transactions based on each provider:

1. Complete e-wallet transactions via ShopeePay [ShopeePay Payment Journey](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#e-wallet-payment-methods)
1. Complete e-wallet transactions via LinkAja [LinkAja Payment Journey](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#e-wallet-payment-methods)
1. Complete e-wallet transactions via DANA [DANA Payment Journey](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#e-wallet-payment-methods)
1. Complete e-wallet transactions via OVO [OVO Payment Journey](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#e-wallet-payment-methods)

To simulate demo transactions, please refer to this section: Simulate [E-Wallet Payments - Product Docs](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#e-wallet-payment-methods)

### Checking transaction status
All created E-wallet transactions are shown in OY! Dashboard. Navigate to “E-Wallet” to see the list of transactions. Inside the dashboard, you can see the details of the transactions, including all the transaction information inputted during creation, status of transactions, and the payment reference number. The dashboard also has a feature to search, filter, and export the list of transactions in various formats: Excel (.xlsx), PDF (.pdf), and CSV(.csv)

There might be times when your customer already completed the payments but the transaction status is not updated to success. Therefore, we also recommend you to check the transaction status periodically via the Check Status E-wallet API. [Check Status E-Wallet - API Docs](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#https-request-check-e-wallet-transaction-status)

### Receiving fund to balance
Once a transaction is paid by the customer, OY! updates the transaction status and sends callback to your system that the transaction has been paid. OY! also sends/settles the funds to your OY! balance. Each provider has a different settlement time, varying from D+1 to D+2 working days. 

## API Payment Routing
Payment Routing API is a service that allows you to receive payments & send money in one integrated API. It enables you to automatically send money to several recipients once you receive payments from your customers. You can save development time by integrating with Payment Routing API as it provides two services at once

#### Use Cases
**Payment Aggregator**

1. Single Payments
    - Single payment is a type of payment that allows your customer to complete payments easily. Available for Bank Transfer (Virtual Account & Unique Code), E-Wallet, QRIS, and Cards.
1. Direct Payments
    - Direct payment requires account linking, meaning that your customer must connect their payment account to your system before completing payments. You can do this by using our API Account Linking. Direct payments offer a more seamless payment experience. After successful linkage, your customer does not need to open or get redirected to the payment provider application to complete payments. This feature is currently only available for e-wallet ShopeePay. 

**Payment Routing**

1. Investment 
    - OJK regulation does not allow investment applications to keep users balance. Use payment routing to receive funds from investors and directly send the funds to custodian banks.
2. E-Commerce
    - Receive goods payments from customers and directly send the merchant’s share to the merchant’s bank account. 
3. Education
    - Receive tuition payments from parents and directly send the admin fee to the school’s bank account 
4. Loan Application
    - Receive loan repayments from the borrower and directly disburse the money to the lender’s pooling account or the borrower’s pooling account.

![Payment Routing Payment Link Scheme](images/acceptingPayments/paymentRouting/payment_routing_sequence_payment_link_scheme.png)

### Features

#### Support multiple payment methods
OY! supports various payment methods in the Payment Routing API, including: 

1. Bank Transfer 
   - Virtual Account: BCA, BNI, BRI, Mandiri, CIMB, BTPN Jenius, BSI, Permata
   - Unique Code: BCA
1. E-wallet
   - Single Payments: ShopeePay, DANA, LinkAja
   - Direct Payments: ShopeePay
1. Cards: Visa, Mastercard, JCB
1. QRIS 

#### Send money to multiple recipients in a real-time manner
Once you receive payments from the customer, OY! can directly send the money up to 10 recipients without waiting for the settlement, as long as you have enough balance in your OY! account. Depending on the payment methods used, some transactions might not be settled real-time to your balance (e.g. QRIS, e-wallet). Therefore, you must  keep enough balance to cater the sending money process.

#### Use Payment Links to receive money
There are two types of receiving money: With UI and Without UI. The Without UI scheme can be used if you have your own checkout page and you only need the payment details information to complete the payments. Here are the payment information you will receive after successful transaction creation:

1. Bank Transfer - Virtual Account: destination bank, VA number, and amount of transaction
1. Bank Transfer - Unique Code: destination bank, bank account number, bank account name, billed amount (original amount), unique amount, and total amount (final amount)
1. QRIS: URL to access the QR code
1. E-wallets: link to redirect your customer to the respective e-wallet selected
1. Cards:  link to redirect your customer to fill in card details and proceed to payment

However, if you do not have your own checkout page, no need to worry as you can use OY’s checkout page (Payment Link) for Payment Routing transactions. You can do so by filling the “need\_frontend” parameter with “TRUE” in the creation API. 

Read more about payment link in [Payment Link - Product Docs](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#payment-link-accepting-payments).


#### Create E-Wallet Direct Payment transactions
Payment Routing API supports Direct Payment transactions where your customer is not redirected to an external payment provider’s application/website to complete payments, resulting in a more seamless transaction and better payment experience. This feature is currently only supported for e-Wallet ShopeePay

Refer to this section to understand how e-Wallet One-Time payments differs from Direct Payments: [E-Wallet Payment Type](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#e-wallet-payment-methods)

#### Transaction tracking and monitoring capability
All created Payment Routing transactions are shown in the OY! Dashboard. Navigate to “Payment Routing” to see the list of created transactions. Inside the dashboard, you can see the details of the transactions, including all the transaction information inputted during creation, the transaction status , and the payment reference number\*. The dashboard also has a feature to search, filter, and export the list of transactions in various formats: Excel (.xlsx), PDF (.pdf), and CSV (.csv)

![Payment Routing Monitoring Transactions](images/acceptingPayments/paymentRouting/payment_routing_monitoring_transactions.png)

\*Payment Reference Number is an identifier of a payment attempt when the customer successfully completes a QRIS payment. The reference number is also displayed in the customer’s receipt/proof of transaction. Only available for QRIS transactions.
#### Use the same Virtual Account number for different transactions
One customer might do payments for multiple transactions and use the same bank each time. By generating the same VA number for different transactions, it makes the payment easier for your customer as they can save the VA number on their mobile banking application. You can only use the same VA number for one active transaction at a time.

[Completing Payment Link transactions - Product Docs](https://docs.oyindonesia.com/#completing-payments-payment-link) 
### Checking transaction status
All created Payment Routing transactions are shown in OY! Dashboard. Navigate to “Payment Routing” to see the list of created transactions. Inside the dashboard, you can see the details of the transactions, including all the transaction information inputted during creation, transaction status, and the payment reference number\*. The dashboard also has a feature to search, filter, and export the list of transactions in various formats: Excel (.xlsx), PDF (.pdf), and CSV (.csv)

If for some reason you do not receive our transaction callbacks successfully, you may use our API Check Status to get the latest transaction status. [Check Status Payment Routing - API Docs](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#check-status-payment-routing-transaction-payment-routing). 
##
\*Payment Reference Number is an identifier of a payment attempt when the customer successfully completes a QRIS payment. The reference number is also displayed in the customer’s receipt/proof of transaction. Only available for QRIS transactions.
### Receiving fund to balance
Once a transaction is paid by the customer, OY! updates the transaction status and sends notification to your system indicating that the transaction has been paid, and settles the funds to your OY! balance. Each payment method has a different settlement time, varying from real-time to D+2 working days. 
### Sending funds to recipients
Payment Routing allows you to disburse funds automatically once the transaction is paid by the customer. OY! automatically sends the funds to the recipient(s) stated in the creation process once the payment is received. You need to make sure that you have enough balance to carry out the disbursement process, especially for payment methods that have non-real time settlement; otherwise, the disbursement process fails due to insufficient balance. 

## API Account Linking
Account Linking is a feature that allows your customer's payment account to be linked to your system using tokenization. By linking the customer’s account upfront, your customer can see their account balance inside your application and later on can complete payments without being prompted for any card details or e-wallet phone number. The feature is currently supported for e-wallet ShopeePay & DANA. 

Account linking feature is free of charge.

**Creating API-generated test links**

1. Create an account
2. Send a request to activate API Payment Link product and obtain staging API Key to your business representative
3. Create a payment link by sending a ‘POST’ request to https://api-stg.oyindonesia.com/api/payment-checkout/create-v2. Enter the required and optional fields, as referenced in the [API reference docs](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#api-create-payment-checkout)

Note: The link generated via API will always be a one-time link.

**Accessing and monitoring the created test payment links**

Whether you create the link through dashboard or API, you can see the details of your link on the OY! Dashboard. The details that can be checked are the created date of the link, amount billed, amount received, expiration date, and status.

**Mock Amount Values for Testing**

During testing, you can set the transaction amount to a certain mock value to simulate a specific scenario.

**Mock Credentials for Testing**

Specifically for payment via Credit Card or Debit Card, you may use the below credentials to simulate an end-to-end payment joruney for a successful transaction in staging environment

| Card Details          | Values                     |
| ----------------------| ---------------------------|
|Card Number            | 2223000000000007           |
|Card Expired Month/Year| 01/39                      |
|Card CVN               | 100                        |
|Card Holder Name       | Testing                    |


**Simulate Credit Card / Debit Card Transaction Callback for Testing**
As an alternative to the above, if you would like to simulate the callback for Credit Card or Debit Card transaction, but not necessarily the end-to-end payment journey, you may manually send callback by following these steps: 

1. Log in to your OY! Dashboard 
2. Select Environment: Demo in the top left corner 
3. Make sure to have inputted your staging callback URL on Settings: 'Developer Options' (tab: Callback Configuration - Payment Link)
4. Create a payment link in Demo environment
5. Click on the link and proceed with Credit Card or Debit Card as your payment method 
6. Copy the Reference Number of the transaction - it should be available under "Transaction Details" 
7. Return to OY! Dashboard and click on the Settings: 'CC-DC Callback" 
8. Paste the Reference Number of the transaction and choose whether you would like to simulate a callback for successful transaction or a failed transaction 
8. Click "Send Callback". OY! will only send callback for a successful transaction whether in staging environment or production environment
